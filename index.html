		<p>
			Hello and welcome to my web portfolio. Here you will find information about me,
			my life story thus far, and professional accomplishments. You are welcome to contact
			me with any questions or comments. Please report any bugs or errors that you find on
			this website (it is still very much under construction).  
		</p>
		<a name="origin"><h2>Origin</h2></a>
		<p>
			I was born in Switzerland. I was raised there for two years before my family moved to 
			New Jersey when I was three. As a child I spent a large portion of my time dreaming 
			about space and saving the universe (I had learnt about the heat death theory too early). 
			Like many other soon-to-be engineers, I played extensively with Legos, trains, and blocks. 
			I would draw schematics of space ships and beg to play video games on the family computer.
		</p>
		<a name="education"><h2>Education</h2></a>
		<p>
			Most of my early education took place in the private school Barnstable Academy. 
			I was placed directly in first grade, skipping kindergarten, and was doing long division 
			by second grade. However, during my fifth year of grade school my family moved to a small 
			rural town Kea`au, on the Big Island of Hawaii. This is where I would spend the remainder 
			of middle and high school education. Although academically the Kea`au public school struggled, 
			it did have its advantages. The schools encouraged all the students to be inclusive and 
			appreciative of the variety of cultures present. I was able to partake in unique extra-curricular 
			activities such as Taiko, tropical agriculture, and world class astronomy. 
		</p>
		<p>
			For my undergraduate I am proud to be attending New York University's Tandon School of Engineering, 
			previously NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, or Poly for short. I currently am in my final 
			semester to completing my Bachelors in Computer Engineering with honors. While I have studying, 
			I have conducted research, participated in Hackathons, and tutored my fellow students. 
			Moving forward, I would like to continue my education, achieving either a doctorate or a masters 
			in Computer Science.  
		</p>
		<a name="plangoal"><h2>Plans & Goals</h2></a>
		<p>
			In many ways I am an idealist. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise that many of my goals are 
			quite grand. In general I would like to accomplish designing a conscious artificial intelligence. 
			Hopefully one that assists in solving humanities greatest problems and does not destroy the human race 
			or murder people in the process. 
		</p>
		<p>
			More realistically, I would like to contribute to projects either in industry or academics that help 
			progress society in some fashion. If I am able to accomplish this while still doing all the cliche 
			stuff (traveling the world, raising a family, etc), then I will be a happy man.
