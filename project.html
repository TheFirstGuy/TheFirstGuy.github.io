			Here you will find descriptions of projects that I have completed or am 
			currently working on. Projects are listed in reverse chronological order. 
			I plan to push most of the code for these projects on to my GitHub in the future. 
			Please contact me with any questions or comments on any of these projects.

		<a name=neural><h2>FPGA Based Neural Network</h2></a>
		<p>
			For my senior project I am leading a team to design an artificial neural network 
			on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). More specifically, we intend to create 
			a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture that is capable of solving a variety 
			of classification problems efficiently, while also being easily scalable. If time 
			permits we would ideally would prefer to create an open source library to allow 
			others to build upon our work.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, we plan to implement out design on a Nexys 4 DDR board that is powered by 
			a Xilinx Artix-7 chip. Although not the most powerful FPGA available, we have chosen 
			it due to our familiarity with the board, its low cost, and integrated sensors. The 
			design of the MLP will be done on the register transfer level using VHDL. Although 
			we were trained to use the Xilinx ISE 14.7 software, we are considering moving over 
			to the newer Xilinx Vivado. However, this will be dependent on how long we believe it 
			would take to reorient ourselves.
		</p>
		<p>
			Neural networks on FPGAs present several challenges. Some of these challenges include, 
			but are not limited to: 
			<ul>
				<li>Managing the connections of synapse between neurons (activators)</li>
				<li>Implementing multiplication in an efficient manner</li>
				<li>Implementing the sigmoid function used in back propagation in an efficient manner</li>
				<li>Pipelining forward activation and back propagation simultaneously</li>
				<li>Exploiting neural network inherent parallelism</li>
			</ul>
			These challenges, along with many others will be tackled over the next few months. 
			I look forward to posting updates as we overcome these challenges.
